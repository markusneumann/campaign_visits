# Count Models and Campaign Visits
Replication data for my analysis on count models and campaign visits, based on the M.A. thesis I wrote two years ago (the pdf of the thesis is in the PDFs folder).

The files to create the maps are in the Python Files folder (and require Python). Everything else is R.

Note: In the paper I wrote that I used state-level fixed effects for the second model. Well, turns out I actually forgot to implement them :(
